# Diabetes
The problem statement is that we would like to create a system that detects if a patient shows the signs and symptoms of early stage diabetes. The goal is to detect these at-risk patients as early as possible to begin treatment and avoid unwanted health complications.

To address this problem, we’ll be using the open-source Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset. We’ll use data preprocessing techniques along with multiple machine learning models to create an adequate classification system. We’ll begin by exploring the data to better understand it.
